This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. The design is inspired by a mix of academic professionalism and a "cyberpunk" terminal aesthetic.

Thanks Google Gemini for constructing this homepage within 15 minutes.

### What to expect?

I'll be posting updates about my research, project releases, and occasional tutorials on 3D vision and graphics programming.

Stay tuned!
